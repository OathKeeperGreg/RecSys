In order to be able to execute algorithms with neural networks, we installed the package Tensorflow 1.15 and tensorflow-estimator 1.15. In more detail, we installed anaconda which provides many ready-made packages and created a virtual environment as follows:

  - Conda create -n py37 python=3.7
  - Conda activate py37
  - Conda install cornac -c cornac-forge
  - Conda install sklearn
  - Conda install tensforflow==1.15
  - Pip install tensorflow-estimator==1.15
